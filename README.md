#Pat's cookie-stand created by Serina Tsang

- used object literals to build a real-world web application (calculate/store/display data).

- created a styleguide (styleguide.html and styleguide.css) to provide a reference tool showing what sort of fonts, colors, and pictures are being used on the website.

- still need to practice/understand/read up on constructor functions to reuse and clean up my code.

- FINALLY figured out how to change to/apply constructor functions, put sales data into a table, generate a form for user's input of new store information, use CSS to make my page pretty including the use of custom google fonts, animation, floats, etc. I also created a web page for Pat with professional photos and styling to market Pat's stores and merchandise.
