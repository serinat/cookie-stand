- used object literals to build a real-world web application (calculate/store/display data).

- created a styleguide (styleguide.html and styleguide.css) to provide a reference tool showing what sort of fonts, colors, and pictures are being used on the website.

- still need to practice/understand/read up on constructor functions to reuse and clean up my code.
